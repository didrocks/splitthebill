/* Different episods:
  - project creation, explaining the template, run/deploy on the phone. Change the locale to en_US.
  - base layout, grid units, size for phone
  - using icons (for +/-), with first, mistakes in the addition (no relation between numPeoplePay and numTotalPeople)
  - protecting your input (validator)
  - how bindings works (advanced bindings)
  - add input methods (as it won't show keyboard) + tricks
    https://developer.ubuntu.com/en/apps/qml/tutorials/ubuntu-screen-keyboard-tricks/
  - factorize components in other files and define API: first non visual element like Bill, then AddRemoveInt
  - more refactoring with the results elements and conditions (like only the orange box for results)
  - state saver (using Bill), app lifecycle management
    -> insist on avoiding the statesaver breaking data-binding when restoring
  - Add 2 ways databindings to be able to store values on both side + redefining defaults and how to change a value
    afterwards.
  - action bar (for save and reset?) instead of button <- TODO
  - Storing values in u1db
  - signal example (in Bill) on value changed
  - Page view with multiple tabs (search view and full view)
  - add styling like the TextField
  - responsive design, portrait mode
  - add currency converter (+ fetching from the web)
  - what happen if the app is or become offline or server doesn't respond?
  - share (email/twitter) (loader with like contenthubloader in address-book-app)
  - importing bills
  - add i18n
  - changing theme
  - save and archive: add Top (textinput + date) and notes at the bottom to be saved
  - add flickable + page stacksâ€¦
  - change date, pick up calendar/time
  - upload app to the store, availability
  - adding flickable, animations to switch between sections (look at reboot weather app)
